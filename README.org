#+TITLE: delve.el

Delve is a tool to delve into your [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org roam zettelkasten]]. Its main
purpose is to find pages by following links (either backlinks or
references made in the page itself). Thus you can quickly overview the
network of interpage relations you have created. For this purpose, you
can also use the predefined searches which attempt to highlight some
focal points of this network (e.g., those pages which have the most
links, or the last modified pages).

Opening Delve the first time, you can browse your zettelkasten by
ROAM_TAG, or use one of the predefined searches. Further functionality
will be added.

Delve inherits and extends the functionality from the now deprecated
[[https://github.com/publicimageltd/org-roam-dashboard][org-roam-dashboard]].

* Obligatory screenshot and some explanation
[[./screenshots/screenshot_last_modified.png]]

On this screenshot, you can see that the user has opened the list of
the last ten modified pages. On the lower part of the buffer, you can
see several tags like "Alias" (I have tagged aliased pages for
debugging purposes), "Begriff" (German for 'concept'), "Dashboard"
(pages of importance for the current project), "Gedanke" (free
standing thought), etc. If I want to see the pages with these tags, I
can move the cursor to that line and press =<TAB>= to expand it. Delve
will present the same type of list as above.

There's quite some information stuffed into each line. Let's take as
an example the first page of the list of the last 10 modified pages:

[[./screenshots/detail.png]]

That page has the title *Imagination*. It has been modified on November,
4th. The icon right beside the date shows that this page is actually
the result of a search for pages. It is tagged as a concept
('Begriff'). Since it is on the top of this result list, it is the
last modified page of the whole database.

As you can see, there are 17 links pointing /from/ that page to some
other page, and 19 other pages which point /to/ that page (backlinks) on
the topic of imagination. The type of links is visualized by using
arrows: 19 pages point to the title, the title points to 17 other
pages.

If you would want to follow these links, you could move te cursor on the
page item and press the right or the left cursor key, respectively. A
sublist would be inserted showing all the links.

Here's an example of such an expanded list:

[[./screenshots/detail2.png]]

The top item is a page with "Criticism of AI" ("Kritik der KI"). There
are two links pointing to that page, incidentally two article
reference pages. These page items have a an arrow pointing to the
right on their very left side, that marks them as "links pointing to
the top file". The last item is a page for the concept "Artificial
Intelligence" ("Künstliche Intelligenz"). As the item on its left side
indicates, that's a link found in the top page ("Criticism of AI")
itself. 

The most important feature is that the user can now look at each of
these linked pages again, and investigate /their/ links. So we could
now, for example, look at what pages link to "Artificial Intelligence"
or what references are made within this page, without leaving Delve.

* Features

Note that this is still a work in progress. See [[#bugs--problems--untested-stuff]] below.

 - Display lists of org roam pages (=Zettel) with additional
   information on backlinks, "tolinks", and modification date.
 - Expand the Zettel item (page) to see backlinks, or links pointing
   to the zettel, or both.
 - Interactively browse the Zettelkasten according to predefined
   searches (Last ten modified pages; top linked pages; etc.)
 - Visit the Zettel at point to edit it. Delve provides an interactive
   command to switch back and forth between the Delve buffers and the
   org roam buffers.
 - Remote editing: From within the tree view, add or remove tags.
 - Additional minor mode (delve-minor-mode) for org roam pages,
   allowing to open a new Delve buffer with the current org roam page
   as top item.

* Installation
** Basic Installation

Delve depends on another tool of mine called [[https://github.com/publicimageltd/lister][lister]]. But neither
package is available at MELPA yet. So you have to download both packes
(=delve= and =lister=) in order to make this work. In the following
example, [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]] is used for downloading the package. Alternatively,
you can download it with another package manager or manually.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lister
  :quelpa (lister :fetcher git
  		  :url "https://github.com/publicimageltd/lister"))

(use-package delve
  :quelpa (delve :fetcher git 
		 :url "https://github.com/publicimageltd/delve")
  :config
  (use-package delve-minor-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'delve-minor-mode-maybe-activate))
  :bind
  (("<f12>" . delve-open-or-select)))

  #+end_src

This snippet above also installs the =delve-minor-mode=. It is a local
minor mode which is only activated if the org mode file visited
belongs to the org roam database (e.g., is placed with in the org roam
directory). See [[#delve-minor-mode]] below.

** Further Configuration
*** Pretty Icons
For pretty icons, install [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons.el]]. If you also want pretty
icons when calling =delve-open-or-select=, use the following option:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq delve-use-icons-in-completions t) ;; per default nil
#+end_src

*** Evil 

=evil-mode= users should add the following snippet to their
configuration to use the default keybinding:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(evil-set-initial-state 'delve-mode 'emacs)
#+end_src

There is [[https://github.com/publicimageltd/delve/issues/3][an issue thread]] where you can post, comment and discuss
possible ways to integrate =delve= into =evil=. Eventually, it will be
merged into the source code, but since I don't use =evil=, I won't be
hurrying it. (Remember, that's a hobby horse!)

* Keybindings

** Delve 

On standard emacs, use the usual navigation keys. Additionally, the
following keys apply:

| Key   | Function                                                   |
|-------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| ENTER | Visit Zettel at point                                      |
| TAB   | Expand on Zettel or search at point, or hide it            |
| LEFT  | Insert list with all backlinks pointing to Zettel at point |
| RIGHT | Insert list with all links in the Zettel at point          |
| +     | Add tag to the Zettel at point                             |
| -     | Remove tag from the Zettel at point                        |
| g     | Refresh the buffer contents                                |
| .     | Refresh the item at point                                  |
| C-l   | Replace current list with the expanded Zettel at point     |
| r     | Revert buffer to the original list                         |
|-------+------------------------------------------------------------|

For integrating =delve= into =evil=, see the [[#evil][section above]],

** Delve minor mode

This is a local minor mode which adds some convenience key bindings to
the org roam page buffer.

Per default, this submap is mapped to the prefix =C-d=. This yields:


| Key | Function                                                                 |
|-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-d d | Open a new delve buffer with the current page as top item, and expand it |
| C-d + | Add a tag                                                                |
| C-d - | Remove a tag                                                             |
|-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|


Using =C-d d= in an org-roam buffer is particularly useful: It
presents all links from the current page as a delve list. See, for
example, the following example of a page with two backlinks (and no
links from the page itself):

[[./screenshots/example-backlinks-org-roam-page.png]]

Pressing =C-d d= creates a tree representation of that buffer:

[[./screenshots/example-backlinks.png]]

The first two items in this list are the backlinks (in the right part
of the org roam buffer ). The other, links with an right arrow
pointing to the left, are those links which point /from/ the current
page to another page (i.e., a link to the page titled "Kreativität"
("Creativity"). Each of these linked pages is displayed with /their/
respective links, so that the user could now expand on them to dive
deeper into the Zettelkasten.

* Bugs / Problems / Untested Stuff

 - *Aliases* are not recognized. Sometimes this leads to undesireable
   results, because you just see the Zettel with the same title listed
   twice or even more often. An algorithm to effectively identify
   duplicates is on the way.
 - There is a general problem with *duplicate items*, not related to
   aliases, which I could not track them down yet.
 - You can currently *mark* items (by pressing =m=) and unmark them all
   (=u=). But you can't do anything with the marked items yet.
